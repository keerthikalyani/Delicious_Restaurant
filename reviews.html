         <font color="white"><P>The good:
          Flavors of the rolls and dessert were the only redeeming part which is why I gave 3 stars but everything else was sorely disappointing. Even then, some of the flavors like the wasabi kizami was overpowering and lacked cohesiveness.

            <font color="white"><P>Cute little restaurant connected to a ramen shop next door. Yonsei is still fairly new, but seems very popular by how far in advance you need reservations.
              I finally found a day that worked for me and took myself out on a sushi date.
              For food, I got the sashimi trio to start, the yonsei hand roll set, and added on three more handrolls.
